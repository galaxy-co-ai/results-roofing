# Sprint Overview

High-level view of project phases, sprints, and milestones.

<!-- AI: This document provides a bird's-eye view of the project timeline. Update as phases complete and sprints are planned. This is a living document that evolves throughout the project. -->

---

## Project Phases

<!-- AI: Track phase progress. Update status as work progresses:
- Not Started: Phase hasn't begun
- In Progress: Currently working on this phase
- Complete: All phase deliverables done and verified -->

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Phase 0 | <!-- AI: In Progress / Complete --> | Project Setup |
| Phase 1 | <!-- AI: Not Started / In Progress / Complete --> | Discovery (docs 01-04) |
| Phase 2A | <!-- AI: Not Started / In Progress / Complete --> | Design - UI/UX |
| Phase 2B | <!-- AI: Not Started / In Progress / Complete --> | Design - Technical |
| Phase 2C | <!-- AI: Not Started / In Progress / Complete --> | Design - Quality |
| Phase 3 | <!-- AI: Not Started / In Progress / Complete --> | Sprint Planning |
| Phase 4+ | <!-- AI: Not Started / In Progress / Complete --> | Execution |

## Sprint List

<!-- AI: Add sprints during Phase 3 (Sprint Planning). For each sprint:
- Number sequentially
- Give descriptive name based on primary focus
- Track status: Pending, In Progress, Complete
- Summarize what the sprint accomplishes

Example:
| 01 | Foundation | 4 | Complete | Core app structure and routing |
| 02 | Data Layer | 4 | In Progress | Database models and API scaffolding |
-->

| Sprint | Name | Phase | Status | Summary |
|--------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| <!-- AI: Add sprints as they are planned --> | | | | |

*Sprints will be defined during Phase 3 (Sprint Planning)*

## Milestones

<!-- AI: Define key milestones for the project. Milestones are significant checkpoints that represent meaningful progress. Examples:
- MVP: Minimum viable product ready for testing
- Alpha: Feature complete, internal testing
- Beta: Ready for external user testing
- v1.0: Production release

For each milestone:
- Name: Short, memorable name
- Target: Sprint number or date when expected
- Description: What must be true for milestone to be reached -->

| Milestone | Target | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| <!-- AI: Define project milestones --> | <!-- AI: Sprint number or date --> | <!-- AI: Milestone criteria --> |

## Phase Gate Criteria

<!-- AI: Reference phase-gates.md for detailed criteria. Summary: -->

Before moving to the next phase, verify:
- All required documents are complete (see [Phase Gates](./phase-gates.md))
- No blocking issues remain
- Stakeholder approval obtained (if required)

## Dependencies

See [DEPENDENCIES.md](../planning/DEPENDENCIES.md) for document dependencies.

<!-- AI: Add sprint dependencies here after Phase 3. Document which sprints must complete before others can begin. -->

## AI Agent Instructions

When working with this sprint overview:

1. **During Planning**
   - Update phase statuses as work progresses
   - Add sprints during Phase 3
   - Define meaningful milestones based on project goals

2. **During Execution**
   - Update sprint statuses
   - Track milestone progress
   - Document any phase delays or scope changes

3. **Maintaining Accuracy**
   - Keep statuses current
   - Update targets when schedules change
   - Cross-reference with progress-tracker.md

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] All phases have accurate status
- [ ] Sprints are defined with clear scope
- [ ] Milestones represent meaningful checkpoints
- [ ] Dependencies documented where needed
