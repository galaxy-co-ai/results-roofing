## Primary Persona

### Profile

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Richard Thompson |
| **Role** | Executive homeowner preparing for life transition |
| **Location** | Highland Park, Texas (or Buckhead, Atlanta) |
| **Age** | 58 years old (Gen X / Boomer cusp) |
| **Household Income** | $325,000/year |
| **Technical Level** | High - uses smartphone, laptop, online banking, comfortable with digital transactions |
| **Primary Goal** | Replace aging roof with premium materials before selling home or as part of home update, without the hassle of managing contractors |

### Background

Richard is a senior executive at a financial services firm. He and his wife bought their Highland Park home 16 years ago, and the roof is now 22 years old. Their insurance carrier recently sent a non-renewal notice citing the roof's age. They're also considering selling in 2-3 years when their youngest finishes college. Richard has heard that a new roof adds significant resale value and speeds up the sale process. He doesn't have time to get multiple quotes, manage contractors, or deal with the typical home improvement hassle. He wants a premium product from a reputable company that handles everything professionally. Money isn't the primary concern—his time and peace of mind are.

### Pain Points (Current State)

| Pain Point | Impact | Frequency |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Time scarcity** | Can't take days off to get quotes and manage contractors. Needs a streamlined, self-service process. | Every home improvement project |
| **Fear of contractor quality** | Heard horror stories about shoddy work, especially in their upscale neighborhood where expectations are high. 70% of homeowners worry about unreliable contractors. | Every interaction with unknown contractor |
| **Insurance carrier pressure** | Received non-renewal notice; needs to act but doesn't want to rush into a bad decision | Immediate urgency |
| **ROI uncertainty** | Knows new roof adds value but wants to understand the real numbers before committing | During decision process |
| **Opaque pricing** | Used to transparent professional services pricing; frustrated by "call for quote" approach. 78% want transparent pricing. | Every quote attempt |
| **Neighborhood standards** | Lives in prestigious area where visible home improvements are scrutinized; needs quality materials that look appropriate | Every exterior project |

### Use Cases

| Use Case | Trigger | Expected Outcome | Frequency |
|----------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Get instant cost estimate** | Receives insurance non-renewal or decides to sell | Sees realistic price range in < 2 minutes from entering address | Once when motivated |
| **Understand ROI and value** | Wants to justify expense to spouse or for resale planning | Clear data on resale value increase (60-68% ROI), faster sale time (1-3 weeks) | Once during decision |
| **Compare premium package options** | Wants top-tier materials appropriate for neighborhood | Side-by-side comparison with material details, warranty differences, aesthetic options | 1-2 times during decision |
| **Get financing options** | Even affluent buyers want to understand payment options (preserve liquidity) | Knows monthly payment options in < 60 seconds without hard credit pull | Once during decision |
| **Schedule appointment** | Ready to proceed, wants to lock in installation | Books specific date/time online without phone tag | Once per project |
| **Track project status** | Work scheduled, wants to know timeline without calling | Portal shows progress, next steps, completion date | Weekly during project |

### Workflow Expectations

Richard expects a premium, professional experience similar to what he gets from his financial advisor or luxury car dealer. He'll start research on his laptop during evening hours or weekend. He wants to gather information independently before any sales conversation. He expects to complete the entire process online if he chooses—no mandatory phone calls, no pressure tactics.

He'll discuss with his wife before finalizing. He needs to easily share a professional-looking quote summary. He prefers email communication with the option for a quick call if needed. He absolutely does not want unsolicited follow-up calls or aggressive sales tactics—that would immediately disqualify a contractor in his mind.

Session length: 10-20 minutes for initial research and estimate, then quick check-ins (< 5 minutes) to review options or complete checkout.

### Success Indicators

| Signal | Indicates |
|--------|-----------|
| Completes quote flow without abandoning | Trust established, experience meets expectations |
| Shares quote link with spouse | Information is credible and professionally presented |
| Selects premium (Best) package | Value proposition resonates with quality-focused buyer |
| Returns to portal to check status | Engaged, trusts the process |
| Refers to neighbor/colleague after project | Genuinely satisfied, willing to stake reputation |
| Leaves positive review mentioning "professional" or "seamless" | Core value proposition delivered |

## Secondary Personas

### Secondary Persona 1: The Downsizing Retiree

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Elizabeth "Beth" Crawford |
| **Role** | Recently retired professional preparing to sell and downsize |
| **Age** | 64 years old (Baby Boomer) |
| **Location** | Paradise Valley, Arizona |
| **Household Income** | $180,000/year (retirement income + investments) |
| **Primary Need** | Maximize sale price of family home before moving to smaller property |
| **Difference from Primary** | More price-conscious despite affluence (fixed income mindset), longer research phase, strong desire for trustworthy company |
| **Priority for MVP** | High - represents significant portion of 43-49% Boomer market |

**Background:** Beth and her husband raised their kids in their Paradise Valley home over 30 years. The roof is original and showing its age. Their realtor told them a new roof would add value and eliminate a common buyer objection. They're not in a rush but want to maximize their nest egg. Beth does thorough research—she'll read reviews, check BBB ratings, and ask neighbors for recommendations. She's comfortable with technology but appreciates when things are clearly explained.

**Key Differences in UX Needs:**
- Wants to understand exactly what she's paying for (detailed breakdowns)
- Cares deeply about company reputation and reviews
- May prefer phone call option once ready to commit
- Will compare 2-3 options before deciding
- Values warranty coverage heavily (won't be there to deal with problems)
- Financing is optional—may pay cash from savings

### Secondary Persona 2: The Young Affluent Professional

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Michael & Sarah Patel |
| **Role** | Dual-income professionals, first luxury home purchase |
| **Age** | 42 and 40 years old (Millennials / Gen X) |
| **Location** | Buckhead, Atlanta, Georgia |
| **Household Income** | $275,000/year |
| **Primary Need** | Update roof on recently purchased older home to match their vision and standards |
| **Difference from Primary** | Both work demanding jobs, zero home improvement experience, expect seamless digital experience, care about aesthetics and energy efficiency |
| **Priority for MVP** | High - represents growing affluent millennial market with highest digital expectations |

**Background:** Michael (tech VP) and Sarah (healthcare exec) bought a 1990s-built home in Buckhead 8 months ago. The inspection noted "roof nearing end of life." They love the location and the bones of the house but want to update it to match their style. They've never managed a major home project and have no contractor relationships. They expect to handle everything digitally—researching on phones during lunch breaks, completing transactions on laptops at night. They want premium materials (considering architectural shingles or metal for curb appeal) and care about energy efficiency for both values and utility savings.

**Key Differences in UX Needs:**
- Expects mobile-first, instant online experience
- Wants premium material options highlighted (not just standard)
- Cares about energy efficiency and sustainability
- Will check Google reviews extensively before engaging
- Prefers text/email; finds phone calls intrusive
- Financing is appealing to preserve investment capital
- Both need access to quote/project info (shared login or easy sharing)

### Secondary Persona 3: Results Roofing Operations Team

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Name** | Carlos (Sales Manager) / Diane (Office Manager) |
| **Role** | Internal staff managing quotes, jobs, and customer communication |
| **Primary Need** | See incoming leads, manage pipeline, track job status, handle scheduling conflicts |
| **Difference from Primary** | Internal user, not customer; needs admin/CRM view, not consumer UX |
| **Priority for MVP** | Low for consumer flow; Medium for portal. JobNimbus is primary tool—MVP integrates, doesn't replace. |

**Notes:** The consumer-facing MVP should automatically sync leads and job status to JobNimbus. A lightweight internal dashboard may be useful for viewing funnel metrics, but full CRM functionality stays in JobNimbus. Defer admin portal features to post-MVP unless critical for operations.

## Anti-Personas

### Who This Is NOT For

| Anti-Persona | Why They're Not a Fit | How to Recognize |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Commercial/Industrial Property Managers** | Different sales process, pricing model, materials, and contract structure. Requires site visits, custom engineering. | Ask about building type, square footage > 10,000 sq ft, flat roof systems |
| **DIY Roof Repairers** | We sell full replacement with professional installation, not materials or guidance for self-install | Ask about buying materials only, watching YouTube tutorials, doing it themselves |
| **Out-of-Area Homeowners** | Service area is Texas, Atlanta GA, Wilmington NC, and Phoenix AZ only for MVP. Can't service other states. | Address outside service area zip codes |
| **Multi-Family/Apartment Complex Owners** | Commercial pricing, different insurance, HOA/board approval complexity, longer sales cycles | Multiple units, mention of tenants, HOA board decisions |
| **Homeowners Seeking Repairs Only** | MVP focuses on full replacement. Repair-only jobs have different economics and scope. | "Just need a few shingles fixed," "small leak repair" |
| **Price-First Bargain Hunters** | Our value proposition is premium quality and seamless experience, not lowest price. Customers comparing solely on price will be disappointed. | Primary concern is finding cheapest option, no interest in material quality or warranty |

### Handling Anti-Persona Inquiries

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Commercial property inquiry | "Our online system is designed for residential roofing. For commercial projects, please call our office at [number] to discuss your specific needs." |
| Out-of-area address entered | "We currently serve select markets in Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona. Enter your email to be notified when we expand to your area." (Lead capture for future) |
| Repair-only request | "Our online estimator is for full roof replacements. For repairs, please call [number] or submit a contact form for a custom assessment." |
| DIY material request | "We provide full-service installation including materials, labor, and warranty. We don't sell materials separately." |
| Price-first shopper | Allow self-selection out through transparent pricing. Clear value proposition attracts quality-focused buyers. |

## Persona Validation Plan

| Assumption | Validation Method | Status |
|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Primary persona is self-pay (not insurance claim) | Track % of leads by motivation (pre-sale, carrier requirement, curb appeal, etc.) | Planned - post-launch |
| Average customer age is 50+ | Optional demographic question in quote flow or post-purchase survey | Planned |
| 78% want transparent pricing | A/B test: pricing visible vs. "call for quote" CTA | Planned - Phase 7 |
| Mobile is primary device for initial research | GA4 device breakdown on quote funnel pages | Planned - post-launch |
| Communication preference is text/email over phone | Survey in portal or track engagement rates by channel | Planned |
| Pre-sale preparation is top motivation | Monitor lead intake answers for motivation | Planned - post-launch |
| Affluent buyers still want financing options | Track financing pre-qual requests vs. cash payments | Planned |

## Key Insights for Product Design

Based on this persona research, the product should prioritize:

1. **Trust signals throughout**: Visible reviews, company history, warranty details, professional presentation. 70% worry about unreliable contractors.

2. **Transparent, itemized pricing**: Full breakdown of materials, labor, permits. 78% want this; only 25% of competitors provide it.

3. **Mobile-first, premium experience**: Affluent users expect quality digital experiences. Every element should feel professional, not "contractor-y."

4. **ROI and value messaging**: Clear communication of resale value increase (60-68% ROI), faster sale time, insurance premium savings (19% with new roof).

5. **Self-pay motivations upfront**: Highlight reasons that resonate: roof age, insurance carrier requirements, pre-sale preparation, curb appeal, energy efficiency.

6. **Financing as option, not necessity**: Show monthly payment options but don't assume financial need. Position as smart capital management.

7. **Communication preferences**: Let customers choose text/email/phone. 40% cite poor communication as top complaint. Default to non-intrusive.

8. **Premium package emphasis**: Affluent buyers in target markets expect top-tier options. Make "Best" package prominent, not just "Good."

9. **No pressure, self-service**: Richard wants to feel in control, not sold to. The UX should educate and enable, not push.

10. **Easy sharing**: Couples and families make decisions together. Make quote sharing seamless and professional.
